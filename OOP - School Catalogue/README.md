This project introduces a simple Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) model to represent a school system. It defines a base class `School` with essential attributes like `name`, `level`, and `numberOfStudents`, alongside getters and setters for these properties, and a method to display school information. Building on this, it introduces two subclasses, `PrimarySchool` and `HighSchool`, each extending `School` with unique properties: `pickupPolicy` for PrimarySchool and `sportsTeams` for HighSchool, enhancing their representations accordingly. Additionally, it provides a functionality to instantiate these classes, create a list of school objects, and display their details in a structured table format, showcasing how inheritance and polymorphism in OOP can be leveraged to model complex systems in a scalable and maintainable way.
