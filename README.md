This project, assigned by Codecademy, was designed to command, track, and score bots in a relatively simple simulation in which the main goal was to have the bots traverse different mazes to reach a target. However this project takes that concept a step further by turning it into a race and has 6 different bots race against each other and record their performance. The entire concept behind the logic of this project is to demonstrate how dynamic python containers can be, they are much more than objects that can store data. Parameters are defined behind the scenes such as a "#" corresponding to a wall that the bot cannot pass within the given boundaries of the martix. This fully automated algorithm shows how relatively simple code can lead to a program that can learn from past mistakes and ultimately achieve a given goal. This project serves as a foundation for more complex algorithms that can traverse a restricted path of a martix until a path is found and the goal is achieved, making it an invaluable tool in the area of data mining.
