  <h2>Flask HTTP Server</h2>
</div>

<a href="https://github.com/TaberNater96/Flask-HTTP-Server" target="_blank">Source Code</a>

![Flask HTTP Server](https://github.com/TaberNater96/Flask-HTTP-Server/blob/main/images/Flask%20HTTP%20Server%20Diagram.png?raw=true)

The goal of this project was to build an HTTP server and walk through the entire pipeline of front-end to back-end, and then back to front-end again. This Flask HTTP server is designed to power a web application by managing data interactions and is highly focussed on the back-end engineering pipeline with a simple user interface. It starts when a user interacts with the application's interface in their web browser. The front-end, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, captures these user actions, whether it's adding new information, viewing existing details, making changes, or removing somethingâ€”and translates them into standardized web requests. For the purposes of this specific project, the main application is a TODO app.

These requests are then routed by the server's API layer to the correct processing logic. The server-side core then takes over, first verifying the incoming data is valid and matches the database schema. It then uses an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) to seamlessly communicate with a PostgreSQL database, where all of the application's data is securely stored and managed. Essential background processes handle the initial setup of the application, manage logging for monitoring, and allow the server to adapt its behavior based on whether it's running in a development, testing, or live production environment, all neatly contained within a Python virtual environment.

## Live Server

This project was designed to command, track, and score bots in a relatively simple simulation in which the main goal was to have the bots traverse different mazes to reach a target. However this project takes that concept a step further by turning it into a race and has 6 different bots race against each other and record their performance. The entire concept behind the logic of this project is to demonstrate how dynamic python containers can be, they are much more than objects that can store data. Parameters are defined behind the scenes such as a "#" corresponding to a wall that the bot cannot pass within the given boundaries of the martix. This fully automated algorithm shows how relatively simple code can lead to a program that can learn from past mistakes and ultimately achieve a given goal. This project serves as a foundation for more complex algorithms that can traverse a restricted path of a martix until a path is found and the goal is achieved, making it an invaluable tool in the area of data mining.

  <h2>Bash Build Script</h2>
</div>

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1    | **File Operations**: Automatically copy necessary files from the source directory to the build directory. |
| 2    | **Version Control Integration**: Extract the current version number from the changelog. |
| 3    | **User Confirmation Workflow**: Implement a user confirmation step to enhance control over the build process. |
| 4    | **Exclude Proprietary Files**: Use advanced logic to identify and exclude proprietary files, protecting sensitive intellectual property. |
| 5    | **Automated Solution**: Streamline the build workflow, reducing manual errors and improving overall efficiency. |

This project aims to create an advanced bash script to automate the build process. The script handles file operations by automatically copying necessary files from the source directory to the build directory, while seamlessly integrating version control. It pulls the current version number from the changelog and includes a user confirmation step, giving you more control over the build process. This script also contains logic to detect and exclude proprietary files, protecting sensitive intellectual property. This automated solution simplifies the build workflow, reduces manual errors, and boosts overall efficiency in software development projects.

  <h2>OOP - School Catalogue</h2>
</div>

This project involves creating a digital school catalog for the New York City Department of Education to hold quick reference material for each school in the city. It uses Python classes and inheritance to create a parent class `School` and two child classes `PrimarySchool` and `HighSchool`. The `School` class includes properties for `name`, `level`, and `numberOfStudents`, with appropriate getters, a setter for `numberOfStudents`, and a `__repr__()` method for displaying school information. The `PrimarySchool` class adds a `pickupPolicy` property and a corresponding getter, while the `HighSchool` class adds a `sportsTeams` property and its getter, both overriding the `__repr__()` method to include their additional properties. This project showcases how inheritance allows specialized classes to share common properties and methods, making the code more modular and maintainable, serving as a foundation for building complex systems requiring organized data handling.

**Results:**

<div id="unit-testing-surfshop" align="center">
  <h2>Unit Testing - Surfshop</h2>
</div>

This Python project involves a test suite designed to assess the functionality of a shopping cart system for a surf shop, part of the Codecademy course work. Utilizing the **unittest** framework, it tests key features, including the addition of single and multiple surfboards to the cart, the application of local discounts, and the validation of checkout dates. The tests employ subtests to efficiently check multiple conditions and use exception handling to confirm proper error responses for invalid actions, such as adding too many surfboards or setting an inappropriate checkout date. This ensures that the surf shop's cart system operates correctly and handles various user actions and inputs effectively.

  <h2>Iterator Objects - Student Rosters</h2>
</div>

This project involves creating a digital school catalog and student roster system with a focus on iterator objects. The catalog includes classes for `School`, `PrimarySchool`, and `HighSchool`, inheriting from the `School` class, which has properties for `name`, `level`, and `numberOfStudents`, with appropriate getters, setters, and a `__repr__()` method. The `PrimarySchool` class adds a `pickupPolicy` property, and the `HighSchool` class includes a `sportsTeams` property, both with getters and overridden `__repr__()` methods. A key component is the `Roster` class, which manages a list of students and allows adding, removing, and iterating through students. By implementing the `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods, the `Roster` class supports iteration, enabling seamless traversal through the list of students. The project is tested using the `unittest` framework to ensure that all classes and methods, especially the iterator functionality in the `Roster` class, work as expected. This demonstrates how iterator objects can enhance the flexibility and usability of a system designed for managing school and student information.

<div id="weather-api" align="center">
  <h2>Weather API</h2>
</div>

This project focuses on developing a weather forecasting tool that retrieves and displays weather information based on a user's input of a zip code. The tool utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data, ensuring that users receive accurate and up-to-date information. The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate the integration of external APIs into a Python application, handling exceptions, and validating user input to maintain robustness and reliability. The importance of this project in software architecture lies in its illustration of several key concepts: API interaction for real-time data retrieval, error handling to manage potential issues during data fetching, and input validation to ensure data integrity. By guiding the user through a simple process of inputting a zip code and receiving weather details, this project shows how external data sources can be leveraged to enhance application functionality, emphasizing the role of well-structured code and user-friendly interfaces in creating effective and responsive software solutions.
